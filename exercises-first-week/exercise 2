In the application used as an example in the previous exercise, could you use different languages? What data stores would be the most convenient? 

 
The previously described application is fixed and no other programming language is supported,from my point of view; 
being a limited system. The module provides real-time export data, which received from devices, in the popular databases. 
The supported DBMS are Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and MySQL. in more explanation details: module is included in the Rapid SCADA installation package 
and does not require separate installation. The (ModDBExport.dll) can be considered as a module library file. 

Returning back to microservices they could be done both in different languages and in different data stores. 
Giving the system absolute freedom. However, communicating all the elements and entities might be a little bit complex
