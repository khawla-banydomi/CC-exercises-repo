#Find an example application, preferably your own, and deduce which pattern it uses. What would have to be done to evolve to a microservices type pattern? 

 
Example : Control system for self- driving vehicles : this control system can be established to deal with self- driving vehicles that connects the different parts of the vehicle to a control
module which corrects the (steering) direction of the driving and the speend ; let us consider for example Real-World Example (Tesla Control Module ); one of the important mentioned 
advantage for this system is that it uses a multi- layered architecture so that the same system can be used if 
certain parts of the car change with time moreover, this module can be used for different models of cars; in another word Only one layer is modified. 

 

It has been developed under a layered architecture, using the TeSLA framework; Tesla control module can be considered as a multi-layer(N-Tier) application
it consists of 5 layers as the following: 

1. User interaction layer
2. Functionality layer
3. Business rules layer
4. Application core layer
5. Database layer

+ Microservices: 

One of the key concept that must be considered within the microservices architecture pattern is that microservices architecture is a distributed architecture,
based on that all the element included within the architecture are fully disconeccted from one other ; additionally it can be accessed remotely using 
one of the following protocols as: ( JMS, REST, SOAP, etc.);The most important feature or characteristics of this distributed nature is the (scalability and deployment)

To evolve microservice into the overmentioned application, it would be importantly to separate the different entities into different microservices 
and communicate more/less with each other by using any communivcation or invoking methods  in order to provide the services.
