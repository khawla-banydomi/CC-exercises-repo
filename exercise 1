Find an example application, preferably your own, and deduce which pattern it uses. What would have to be done to evolve to a microservices type pattern?

Control system for self- driving vehicles 

A control system for self- driving vehicles connects the different parts of the vehicle to a control module that corrects the direction of the driving, speed, and trajectory. 

Tesla Control Module (tesla.com). 

Waymo software (waymo.com). 

Control systems for self- driving cars use a multi- layered architecture: the same system can be used if some parts of the car change with time, or can be used for different models of cars. Only one layer is modified. 

 

It has been developed under a layered architecture, using the TeSLA framework. 

Tesla control module can be considered as a multi-layer(N-Tier) application it consistes of 5 layers as the following: 

User interaction layer:  

Functionality layer:  

Business rules layer:  

Application core layer:  

Database layer: 

 

 

An important key concept within the microservices architecture pattern is that it is a distributed architecture, meaning that all the components within the architecture are fully decoupled from one other and accessed through some sort of remote access protocol like ( JMS, REST, SOAP, etc.). The distributed nature of this architecture pattern is how it achieves some of its superior scalability and deployment characteristics. 

To evolve the application, it would be necessary to separate the different entities into different microservices and communicate with each other to provide a service.
