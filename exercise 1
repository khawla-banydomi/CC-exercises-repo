Last but not least: NFR: (non-functional requirements): there are numerous NFR regarding the selected application: for illustration: Users must change the initially assigned login password immediately after the first successful login. Moreover, 
the initial should never be reused.Every unsuccessful attempt by a user to access an item of data shall be recorded on an audit trail.A website should be capable

The software should be portable. So moving from one OS to other OS does not create any problem.
